# -Rule-based-cahtbot-with-NLP
 I will show you how to build your very own chatbot using Python. There are broadly two variants of chatbots, Rule-based and Self-learning.
 A rule-based bot uses some rules on which it is trained, while a self-learning bot uses some machine-learning-based approach to chat.
I will show you how to create a simple and quick chatbot in python using a rule-based approach.
Create the chatbots list of recognizable patterns and itâ€™s a response to those patterns. To do this we will create a variable called pairs.
